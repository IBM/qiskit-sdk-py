    A new class :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PhaseEstimation` has been
    added to :mod:`qiskit.circuit.library`. This circuit library class is
    used for is used to estimate the phase :math:`\phi` of an eigenvalue
    :math:`e^{2\pi i\phi}` of a unitary operator :math:`U`, provided with the
    corresponding eigenstate :math:`|psi\rangle`. That is

    .. math::

        U|\psi\rangle = e^{2\pi i\phi} |\psi\rangle

    This estimation (and thereby this circuit) is a central routine to several
    well-known algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm or Quantum Amplitude
    Estimation.
