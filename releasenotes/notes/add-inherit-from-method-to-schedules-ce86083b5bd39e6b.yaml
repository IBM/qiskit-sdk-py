    A class method `inherit_from` is added to `Schedule` and `ScheduleBlock`.
    This method initializes an empty schedule by taking attributes from other schedule.

    .. code-block:: python

        sched = Schedule(name='my_sched')
        new_sched = Schedule.inherit_from(sched)

        assert sched.name == new_sched.name
