    The ability to pass qubit and measurement LO frequencies has now been added to circuit jobs at
    both the job and experiment (individual circuit) level.

    At the job level, the fields ``default_qubit_los`` and ``default_meas_los`` may be used as
    arguents to ``execute`` for both circuit and pulse jobs. The fields are lists of floats
    representing qubit drive and measure lo frequencies (in Hz) and are indexed by qubit number
    (entry 0 is qubit 0, entry 1 is qqubit 1, etc...). The length of the list must be equal to the
    number of qubits in the system. The same functionality is provided by passing the arguments
    ``qubit_lo_freq`` and ``meas_lo_freq`` to assemble. For example, consider running circuit
    ``circ`` on some ``backend`` with 3 qubits. You want to use qubit frequencies
    ``[5e9, 4.9e9, 5.1e9]`` (Hz) and measurement frequencies ``[5.5e9, 6.5e9, 7.1e9]``. This can be
    achieved by::

      job = execute(circ, backend, default_qubit_los=[5e9, 4.9e9, 5.1e9], default_meas_los=[5.5e9, 6.5e9, 7.1e9])

    or::

      qobj = assemble(circ, backend, qubit_lo_freq=[5e9, 4.9e9, 5.1e9], meas_lo_freq=[5.5e9, 6.5e9, 7.1e9])

    Support has also been added for returning ``qubit_lo_range`` and ``meas_lo_range`` from
    qasm-only backends. This will allow users to determine reasonable values for ``qubit_lo_freq``
    and ``meas_lo_freq``. These fields can be accessed by::

      qubit_lo_range = backend.configuration().qubit_lo_range
      meas_lo_range = backend.configuration().meas_lo_range

    Bug where ``qubit_lo_range`` and ``meas_lo_range`` were not being used to check
    ``qubit_lo_freq`` and ``meas_lo_freq`` values.
