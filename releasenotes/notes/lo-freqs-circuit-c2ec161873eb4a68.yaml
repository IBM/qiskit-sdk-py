    The ability to pass qubit and measurement LO frequencies has now been added to circuit jobs. You
    can use the fields ``qubit_lo_freq`` and ``meas_lo_freq`` as arguments to either ``execute`` or
    ``assemble`` with circuit and pulse jobs. The fields are lists of floats representing
    frequencies in Hz and are indexed by qubit number (entry 0 is qubit 0, entry 1 is qubit 1,
    etc...). The length of the list must be equal to the number of qubits in the system. For
    example, consider running circuit ``circ`` on some ``backend`` with 3 qubits. You want to use
    qubit frequencies ``[5e9, 4.9e9, 5.1e9]`` (Hz) and measurement frequencies
    ``[5.5e9, 6.5e9, 7.1e9]``. This can be achieved by::

      job = execute(circ, backend, qubit_lo_freq=[5e9, 4.9e9, 5.1e9], meas_lo_freq=[5.5e9, 6.5e9, 7.1e9])

    or::

      qobj = assemble(circ, backend, qubit_lo_freq=[5e9, 4.9e9, 5.1e9], meas_lo_freq=[5.5e9, 6.5e9, 7.1e9])

    Support has also been added for returning ``qubit_lo_range`` and ``meas_lo_range`` from
    qasm-only backends. This will allow users to determine reasonable values for ``qubit_lo_freq``
    and ``meas_lo_freq``. These fields can be accessed by::

      qubit_lo_range = backend.configuration().qubit_lo_range
      meas_lo_range = backend.configuration().meas_lo_range

    Bug where ``qubit_lo_range`` and ``meas_lo_range`` were not being used to check
    ``qubit_lo_freq`` and ``meas_lo_freq`` values.
