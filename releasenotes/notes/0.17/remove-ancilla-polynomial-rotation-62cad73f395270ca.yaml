upgrade:
  - |
    Remove the use of an ancilla register in the polynomial pauli 
    rotations.
  - |
    The ``q_ancillae`` kwarg for the :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.mcry`
    method for the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` class is no longer
    required and defaults to ``None`` now. This was done to be consistent with
    the other multiple-controlled Pauli rotation gates methods,
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.mcrx` and
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.mcrz`, which do not have a 
    ``q_ancillae`` kwarg.
