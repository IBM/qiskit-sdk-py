    The Qiskit Terra 0.17.0 includes many new features and bug fixes. The
    major features of this release are:

      * The introduction of the :mod:`qiskit.algorithms` and
        :mod:`qiskit.opflow` modules which were migrated from the
        :mod:`qiskit.aqua` project.
      * ``Bit`` objects (ie :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Qubit` and
        :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Clbit`) have been updated so that they are
        no longer required to be part of ``Register`` objects (ie
        :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumRegister` and
        :class:`~qiskit.circuit.ClassicalRegister`). It is also now possible
        to create a circuit without any registers.
      * 

features:

    A new module :mod:`qiskit.algorithms` has been introduced. This module
    contains functionality equivalent to what has previously been
    provided by the :mod:`qiskit.aqua.algorithms` module (which is now
    deprecated) and provides the building blocks for constructing quantum
    algorithms. For details on migrating from ``qiskit-aqua`` to this new
    module please refer to the migration guide "INSERT LINK HERE"

    A new module :mod:`qiskit.opflow` has been introduced. This module
    contains functionality equivalent to what has previously been
    provided by the :mod:`qiskit.aqua.operators` module (which is now
    deprecated) and provides the operators and state functions which are
    used to build quantum algorithms. For details on migrating from
    ``qiskit-aqua`` to this new module please refer to the migration guide
