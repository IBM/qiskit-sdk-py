    When creating a new :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Register` or
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` object with a number of bits, it
    is now required the number of bits are integers (or castable to unambiguous
    integers, e.g. 2.0). Non-integer values will now raise an error as the
    intent in those cases was unclear (you can't have fractional bits). For
    more, information on why this was changed refer to:
    `#4855 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/4885>`__
