    This release is a bugfix release that primarily fixes compatibility with
    the last numpy release. The 1.20.0 numpy release deprecated their local aliases for
    Python's numeric types (``np.int`` -> ``int``, ``np.float`` -> ``float``,
    etc.) and the usage of these aliases in Qiskit resulted in a large number
    of deprecation warnings being emitted. This release fixes this so
    you can run Qiskit with numpy 1.20.0 without those deprecation warnings.
