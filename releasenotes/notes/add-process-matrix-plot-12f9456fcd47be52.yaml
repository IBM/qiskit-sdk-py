    Add ``plot_process_city`` function to visualization module.
    This function visualize process matrix given by ndarray in a cityscape fashion,
    for example::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
        from qiskit import quantum_info as qi
        from qiskit.visualization import plot_process_city

        qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
        qc.cx(0, 1)

        plot_process_city(qi.Chi(qc).data)
