    The interpretation of the `meas_map` has historically been that any measurement of
    `qubit<i>` must be accompanied by a measurement of all qubits in `meas_map[i]`.
    However, the interpretation should now be that the qubits in `meas_map[i]` may not be
    measured disjointly in time such that they overlap incompletely.
    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Good
        meas_map = [[0, 1]]
        sched = pulse.Schedule()
        sched = sched.append(pulse.Acquire(10, acq1))

        sched = pulse.Schedule()
        sched = sched.append(pulse.Acquire(10, acq1))
        sched = sched.append(pulse.Acquire(10, acq2))

        sched = pulse.Schedule()
        sched = sched.append(pulse.Acquire(10, acq1))
        sched = sched.append(pulse.Acquire(10, acq2)) << 10

        meas_map = [[0], [1]]
        sched = pulse.Schedule()
        sched = sched.append(pulse.Acquire(10, acq1))
        sched = sched.append(pulse.Acquire(10, acq2)) << 1

        # Bad
        meas_map = [[0, 1]]
        sched = pulse.Schedule()
        sched = sched.append(pulse.Acquire(10, acq1))
        sched = sched.append(pulse.Acquire(10, acq2)) << 1
