deprecations:
  - |
    Two ``QuantumCircuit`` methods ``combine()`` and ``extend()`` are deprecated,
    in favor of ``QuantumCircuit.compose()``. The latter allows more flexibility
    in composing two circuits that do not have matching registers. It does not,
    however, automatically add qubits/clbits unlike the deprecated methods.
