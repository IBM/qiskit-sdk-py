    Added a transpiler pass to run the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm for approximating single-qubit
    unitaries using a discrete gate set. In combination with the basis translator, this allows
    to convert any unitary circuit to a universal discrete gate set, which could be implemented
    fault-tolerantly.
