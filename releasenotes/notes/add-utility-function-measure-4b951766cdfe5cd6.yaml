    Added a utility function - ``measure`` and ``measure_all`` in pulse module to measure qubits
    using OpenPulse. For example::

        from qiskit.scheduler.utils import measure, measure_all
        from qiskit.pulse import Schedule

        measure_q0_schedule = measure(qubits=[0], backend=backend)
        measure_all_schedule = measure_all(backend)
