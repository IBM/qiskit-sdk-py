    Added a utility function - ``measure`` and ``measure_all`` in pulse module to measure qubits
    using OpenPulse. For example::

        from qiskit.pulse import measure, Schedule

        sched = Schedule(name="my_pulse")
        sched += measure(qubits=[0], backend=backend)
        schedule1 = measure_all(backend)
