    Added a utility function - ``measure`` and ``measure_all`` in pulse module to measure qubits
    using OpenPulse. For example::

        from qiskit.scheduler.utils import measure, measure_all
        from qiskit.pulse import Schedule

        sched = Schedule(name="measure_q0_schedule")
        sched += measure(qubits=[0], backend=backend)
        schedule1 = Schedule(name="measure_all_schedule")
        schedule1 += measure_all(backend)
