    Added a utility function - ``measure`` in pulse module to measure qubits using OpenPulse.
    For example::

      from qiskit.pulse import measure, Schedule

      sched = Schedule(name="my_pulse")
      sched = measure(qubits=[0], schedule=sched, backend=backend, inst_map=None, meas_map=None)
