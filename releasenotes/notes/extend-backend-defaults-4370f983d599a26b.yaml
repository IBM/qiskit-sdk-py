features:

    PulseDefaults (accessed normally as backend.defaults()) has an attribute,
    `ops_def` which has the methods of CmdDef. CmdDef will be deprecated. The
    new `ops_def` is a `OperationScheduleMap` object with three new functions
    beyond what CmdDef had:
      - qubit_ops(qubits) returns the operations defined for the qubits
      - assert_has(operation, qubits) raises an error if the op isn't defined
      - remove(operation, qubits) like pop, but doesn't require parameters
    There are some differences from the CmdDef:
      - __init__ takes `defaults.pulse_library` and `defaults.cmd_def`
      - cmds and cmd_qubits are deprecated and replaced with ops and
        qubits_with_op

    Example:
        backend = provider.get_backend(backend_name)
        ops_def = backend.defaults().ops_def
        qubit = ops_def.qubits_with_op('u3')[0]
        x_gate = ops_def.get('u3', qubit, P0=np.pi, P1=0, P2=np.pi)
        pulse_schedule = x_gate(DriveChannel(qubit))

other:

    In PulseDefaults (accessed normally as backend.defaults()),
    qubit_freq_est and meas_freq_est are now returned in Hz rather than GHz.
    This means the new return values are 1e9 * their previous value.
