deprecations:
  - |
    The JSONschema files and usage for the IBMQ API payloads are deprecated
    and will be removed in a future release. This includes everything under
    the :mod:`qiskit.schemas` module, both the validation methods, exception
    classes, and actual json files. This also includes the ``validate`` kwargs
    for :meth:`qiskit.qobj.QasmQobj.to_dict` and
    :meth:`qiskit.qobj.QasmQobj.to_dict`. The schema files have been moved
    to the `Qiskit/ibmq-schemas <https://github.com/Qiskit/ibmq-schemas>`__
    repository and those should be treated as the canonical versions of the
    API schemas, moving forward only those schemas will recieve updates and
    will be used for the source of truth for the schemas. If you were relying
    on the schemas bundled in qiskit-terra you should instead update to
    use that repository instead.
