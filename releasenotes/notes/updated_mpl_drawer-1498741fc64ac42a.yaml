features:
  - |
    A new kwarg, ``cregbundle`` has been added to the
    :func:`qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer` function and the
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` method
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw`. When set to ``True`` the
    cregs will be bundled into a single line in circuit visualizations for the
    ``text`` and ``mpl`` drawers. The default value is ``True``.
    Fixes issue #4290
    For example:
    
    .. jupyter-execute::
    
        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
        circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)
        circuit.measure_all()
        circuit.draw(output='mpl', cregbundle=True)
  - |
    A new kwarg, ``initial_state`` has been added to the
    :func:`qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer` function and the
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` method
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw`. When set to ``True`` the
    initial state will now be included in circuit visualizations for all drawers.
    Fixes issue #4293
    For example:
    
    .. jupyter-execute::
    
        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
        circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)
        circuit.measure_all()
        circuit.draw(output='mpl', initial_state=True)
  - |
    Labels will now be displayed when using the 'mpl' drawer. There are 2
    types of labels - gate labels and control labels. Gate labels will
    replace the gate name in the display. Control labels will display
    above or below the controls for a gate.
    Fixes issues #3766, #4580
    For example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
        circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)
        circuit.append(YGate(label='A Y Gate').control(label='Y Control'), [0, 1])
        circuit.draw(output='mpl')
deprecations:
  - |
    The style dictionary key ``cregbundle`` has been deprecated and will be
    removed in a future release. This has been replaced by the
    kwarg ``cregbundle`` added to the
    :func:`qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer` function and the
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` method
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw`.
    The default value is ``True``. 
fixes:
  - |
    On some occasions long gate and register names would overflow, or leave
    excessive empty space around them. This has been fixed by using correct
    text widths for a proportional font. Fixes ssues #4611, #4605, #4545,
    #4497, #4449, #3641.
  - |
    When using the style dictionary key 'showindex', the index numbers at
    the top of the column did not line up properly. This has been fixed.
  - |
    The drawer now consistently captializes gate names.
  - |
    When using cregbunde=True and measuring onto a second fold, the measure
    arrow would overwrite the creg count. The count was moved to the left
    to prevent this. Fixes #4148
  - |
    The controlled swap and controlled rzz gates now display with their
    appropriate symbols instead of in a box.
  - |
    Controlled gates created using the to_gate() method were not properly
    spacing and could overflow onto other gates. This has been fixed.
  - |
    Controlled X gates with more than 2 controls now display the same
    target-cross instead of an X in a box.
  - |
    Gates with arrays as parameters, such as Hamiltonian, no longer display
    with excessive space around them. Fixes #4352
  - |
    Gates created using the Gate() method now display the proper background
    color for the gate. Fixes #4496
  - |
    An 'Attribute Error' that occurred when using isometry or initialize
    has been fixed. Fixes #4439
  - |
    Some open-controlled gates did not properly display the open conntrols.
    They now do. Issue #4248
  - |
    The style dictionary key 'backgroundcolor' now properly displays the color.
  - |
    Setting the fold parameter to the draw() method to -1 will now properly
    display the circuit with no folding. Fixes #4506
