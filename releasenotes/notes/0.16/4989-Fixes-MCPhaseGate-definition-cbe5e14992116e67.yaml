fixes:
  - |
    Previously, when creating a multiply controlled phase gate via
    :meth:`qiskit.circuit.library.PhaseGate.control`, an
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.MCU1Gate` gate had been incorrectly
    returned. This has been fixed so that an
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.MCPhaseGate` is correctly returned now.
  - |
    Previously, attempting to call
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.decompose` on a
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` object containing an
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.MCPhaseGate` would would raise an error due
    to an inconsistency in the
    :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.library.MCPhaseGate.definition` attribute. This issue
    has been fixed and the
    :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.library.MCPhaseGate.definition` attribute corrected.
