fixes:
  - |
    The :class:`~qiskit.circuit.libray.SXGate` class's
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.library.SXGate.inverse` method had previously
    returned an ``sx_dg`' gate with a correct
    ``definition`` but incorrect ``to_matrix()`` method. This has been fixed
    so that :meth:`qiskit.circuit.library.SXGate.inverse` returns
    a :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.SXdgGate` object and vice versa.
  - |
    Previously, the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Instruction` class's
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.Instruction.inverse` method would in some cases
    (when not overriden by a subclass) return a :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate`
    instance with an incorrect :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate.to_matrix` method.
    This has been fixed so that these cases with an invalid
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate.to_matrix` no longer occur.
  - |
    Previously, a :class:`~qiskit.circuit.libray.C3XGate` object created with a
    non-zero ``angle`` argument would generate an incorrect gate when
    inverting the gate with :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.libray.C3XGate.inverse`.
    This issue has been fixed and the correct gate is now returned by
    :meth:`qiskit.circuit.libray.C3XGate.inverse`.
  - |
    The :class:`~qiskit.circuit.MCXGate` modes have been updated to return a
    gate of the same mode when calling
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.libray.MCXGate.inverse`. This fixes an issue where
    in some cases, transpiling a circuit containing the inverse of an
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.MCXVChain` gate would raise an error.
    Fixes `#4953 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/4953>`__
