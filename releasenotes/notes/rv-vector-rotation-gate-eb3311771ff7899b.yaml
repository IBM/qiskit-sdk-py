    Added a general single-qubit rotation gate
    (:py:class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.generalized_gates.RVGate`) that has an
    alternative parameterization compared to the UGate. Instead of specifying
    Euler angles, the three components of a rotation vector (vx, vy, vz)
    are specified where the direction of the vector specifies the rotation
    axis and the vector magnitude specifies the rotation angle about the axis
    as a multiple of pi radians.
