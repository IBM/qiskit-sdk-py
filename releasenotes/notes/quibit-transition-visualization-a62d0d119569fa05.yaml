    Single-qubit gate transition visualization tool. Give 
    it a list of gates to apply and it will return an animation
    of qubit state transitions.

    Only X, Y, Z, S, SDG, H and T gates supported.

    for example::

      from qiskit.visualization import animate_gates

      list_of_gates = ['X', 'Y', 'S', 'T']
      visualize_transition(list_of_gates)
