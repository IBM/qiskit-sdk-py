    A new version of the providers interface has been added. This new interface,
    which can be found at :mod:`qiskit.providers.v2`, provides a new versioning
    mechanism that will enable changes to the interface to happen in a
    compatible manner over time. The new interface should be simple to migrate
    existing providers to. Besides having explicitly versioned abstract classes
    the key changes for the v2 interface are that the
    :class:`qiskit.providers.v2.backend.BackendV1`
    :meth:`~qiskit.providers.v2.backend.BackendV1.run` method can now
    take a :class:`~qiskit.circuits.QuantumCircuit` or
    :class:`~qiskit.pulse.Schedule` object as inputs instead of ``Qobj`` 
    objects. To go along with that options are now part of a backend class
    so that users can configure run time options when running with a circuit.
    The final change is that :class:`qiskit.providers.v2.JobV1` can now be
    synchronous or asynchronous, the exact configuration and method for
    configuring this is up to the provider, but there are interface hook
    points to make it explicit which execution model a job is running under
    in the ``JobV1`` abstract class.
