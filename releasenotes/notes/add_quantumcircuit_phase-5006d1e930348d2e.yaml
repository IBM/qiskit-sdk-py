    Adds a `phase` attribute to `QuantumCircuit` for tracking global
    phase. This allows, for instance, to have the `to_matrix` method
    of a gate to exactly correspond to its decompositions instead of
    just up to a global phase. The same attribute has also been
    extended to DAGCircuit so the phase can be tracked when converting
    between QuantumCircuit and DAGCircuit. For example::

      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
      circ = QuantumCircuit(1, phase=math.pi)
      circ.u1(0)

    The global phase may also be set or queried with the `circ.phase`
    property. If the circuit is converted to an instruction or gate
    the global phase is represented by two single qubit rotations on
    the first qubit.
