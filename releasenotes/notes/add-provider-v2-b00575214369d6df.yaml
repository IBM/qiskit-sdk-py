    A new version of the :class:`~qiskit.providers.Provider` abstract interface,
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.ProviderV2`. This new version is fully compatible
    with v1 except that :attr:`~qiskit.providers.ProviderV2.backends` is an
    attribute that contains a :class:`~qiskit.providers.BackendsList` object
    which is callable to retain the behavior of the
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.ProviderV1` method
    :meth:`~qiskit.providers.ProviderV1.backends` but also enables attribute
    access by name for all the backends provided by the ``Provider``.
    Implementers of :class:`~qiskit.providers.Provider` should upgrade to
    this new version to add the extra functionality.
