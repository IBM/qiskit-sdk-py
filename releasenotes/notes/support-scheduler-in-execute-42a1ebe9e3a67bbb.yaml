    Circuits can be scheduled during ``execute`` by setting ``schedule_circuit=True``.
    This allows users building ``QuantumCircuits`` to make use of custom scheduler
    methods, such as the ``as_late_as_possible`` and ``as_soon_as_possible`` methods.
    For example::

        job = execute(qc, backend, schedule_circuit=True, scheduling_method="as_late_as_possible")
