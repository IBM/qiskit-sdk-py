    A new requirement has been added to the requirements list,
    `ordered-set <https://pypi.org/project/ordered-set/>`_. It is an MIT
    licensed implementation of a set that maintains insertion ordering. This is
    being added to speed up operations in the
    :class:`qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit` that heavily rely on lookups from a
    list.
