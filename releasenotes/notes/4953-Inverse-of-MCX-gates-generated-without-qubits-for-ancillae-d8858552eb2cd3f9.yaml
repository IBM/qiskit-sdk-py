fixes:
  - |
    ``SXGate().inverse()`` had previously returned an 'sx_dg' gate with a correct
    ``definition`` but incorrect ``to_matrix``. This has been updated such that
    ``SXGate().inverse()`` returns an ``SXdgGate()`` and vice versa.
  - |
    ``Instruction.inverse()``, when not overridden by a subclass, would in some
    cases return a ``Gate`` instance with an incorrect ``to_matrix`` method. The
    instances of incorrect ``to_matrix`` methods have been removed.
  - |
    For ``C3XGate`` with a non-zero ``angle``, inverting the gate via
    ``C3XGate.inverse()`` had previously generated an incorrect inverse gate.
    This has been corrected.
