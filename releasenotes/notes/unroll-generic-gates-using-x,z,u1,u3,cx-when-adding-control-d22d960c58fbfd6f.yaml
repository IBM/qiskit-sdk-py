    A bug was fixed for when a generic gate is converted to a controlled
    version. Previusly it was unrolled using u1,u3,cx gates before generating
    the controlled version for each of these gates. This caused simple operations
    to be decomposed to multiple controlled x,y,z rotations. Currently gates is
    unrolled using x,z,u1,u3,cx gates allowing for more robust decomposion
