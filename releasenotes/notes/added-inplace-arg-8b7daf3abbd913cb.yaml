    ``qiskit.result.utils.marginal_counts()`` now has a third argument
    ``inplace`` which is ``False`` by default. Changing ``inplace=True`` 
    operates on the original argument which can change the ``Result`` object 
    passed to ``marginal_counts()``. This behaviour is limited
    to ``Result`` object and does not affect if a dictionary is passed
    as argument.
