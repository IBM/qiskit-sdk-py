        A new layout method is introduced based on the CSPLayout but features an additional noise awareness.
    
        * :class:`qiskit.transpiler.layout.csp_layout` got refactored. Especially the `run` method has been split into smaller functional methods. This allows for inheriting the CSPLayout class.
        * :class:`qiskit.transpiler.layout._crb_solver` got introduced to wrap the custom recursive backtracking solver.
        * :class:`qiskit.transpiler.layout.csp_layout_noise` is inherited from csp_layout and features a new layout method which is a noise aware csp_layout.
