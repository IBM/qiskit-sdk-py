    Fixed basic scheduler such that the scheduler respects MemorySlots
    in QuantumCircuit measures. With this fix, the measure stimulus pulses will only
    play on qubits which were explicitly measured, rather than all the qubits in the
    ``meas_map`` group. (Related to GitHub issue `#2704 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/2704>`__)
