    ``qiskit.qasm2`` supersedes ``qiskit.qasm`` which has been removed.
    ``qiskit.qasm2`` also provides a functional interface to openqasm2 source
    loading and exporting. This supersedes the use of :class:`QuantumCircuit`
    member functions to load or export openqasm2 source for ``QuantumCircuit``.
    Those member functions, ``qasm()`` ``from_qasm_string()`` and
    ``from_qasm_file()`` are now deprecated.

    Example

.. code-block:

      from qiskit.qasm2 import load, unload
      circ = load(filename=filename),
      print(export(circ))
