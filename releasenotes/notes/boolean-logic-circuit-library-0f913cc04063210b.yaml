prelude: >
    A library of quantum circuits is introduced in ``qiskit.circuit.library``.
    This library contains useful circuits which can be used as-is, or can be
    used as subcircuits in building up other circuits. The contents of this
    library will grow over time.
features:
  - |
    A few simple circuits for basic boolean logic operations such as ``shift``,
    ``permutation``, and ``inner_product`` are added to
    ``qiskit.circuit.library``.
