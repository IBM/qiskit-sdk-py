features:

    Added ``average_gate_fidelity`` and ``gate_error`` functions for
    ``qiskit.quantum_info`` operator and quantum channel objects.
upgrade:
  - |
    Changed second argument of ``process_fidelity`` function to be optional.
    If a target unitary is not specified, the process fidelity of the input
    channel with the identity operator will be returned.

    The ``require_cptp`` kwarg of the ``process_fidelity`` function has been
    deprecated. It is superseded by two separate kwargs ``require_cp`` and
