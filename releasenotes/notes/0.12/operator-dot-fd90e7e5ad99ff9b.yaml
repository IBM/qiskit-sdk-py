features:
  - |
    Added a new abstract method
    :meth:`qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.dot` to
    the abstract ``BaseOperator`` class, so it is included for all
    implementations of that abstract
    class, including :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.Operator`` and
    ``QuantumChannel`` (e.g., :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.Choi`)
    objects. This method returns the right operator multiplication
    ``a.dot(b)`` :math:`= a \cdot b`. This is equivalent to
    calling the operator
    :meth:`qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.compose` method with the kwarg
    ``front`` set to ``True``.
upgrade:
  - |
    Changed :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.Operator` magic methods so that
    :meth:`qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.__mul__` which gets executed by
    using python's multiplication implements right matrix
    multiplication (ie :meth:`qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.dot`), and
    :meth:`qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.__rmul__` implements scalar
    multiplication (ie :meth:`qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.multiply`).
    Previously both methods implemented scalar multiplciation.
