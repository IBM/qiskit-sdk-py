    The ``Result`` object will now raise a warning when attempting to fetch
    results using either a ``QuantumCircuit`` or ``Schedule`` instance, when
    more than one entry matching the instance name is present in the ``Result``
    object. Note that only the first entry matching this name will be returned.
    To access, all entries, query the result object by index.
