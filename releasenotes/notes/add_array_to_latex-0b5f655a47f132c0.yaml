features:
  - |
    :class:`Statevector` and :class:`DensityMatrix` classes now have :meth:`__ipython_dispay__`
    methods for viewing in Jupyter Notebooks and other environments that support
    it.

    .. jupyter-execute::

            from qiskit.quantum_info import Statevector
            Statevector.from_label('+r')

  - |
    :class:`Statevector` and :class:`DensityMatrix` classes now have ``.draw()`` methods
    allowing them to be drawn as text matrices, LaTeX source matrices,
    markdown, Q-spheres, Bloch spheres and Hinton plots.

    .. jupyter-execute::

            from qiskit.quantum_info import DensityMatrix
            dm = DensityMatrix.from_label('0r')
            dm.draw('markdown')

  - |
    Can now use :func:`array_to_latex()` to represent vectors and matrices as
    human-friendly LaTeX.

    .. jupyter-execute::

            from qiskit.visualization import array_to_latex
            from numpy import sqrt, exp, pi
            mat = [[0, exp(pi*.75j)],
                   [1/sqrt(8), 0.875]]
            array_to_latex(mat)
