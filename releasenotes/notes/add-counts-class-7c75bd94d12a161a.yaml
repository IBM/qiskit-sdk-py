    A new class, :class:`qiskit.result.Counts` has been added. This class
    is a subclass of ``dict`` and . It is created by passing a dictionary
    of counts with the keys being hexademical strings of the form ``'0x4a'``
    and the value is the number of shots. For example::

      from qiskit.result import Counts

      counts = Counts({"0x0': 1, '0x1', 3, '0x2': 1020})

    A Counts object can be treated as a dictionary of binary string keys
    like the output of :meth:`qiskit.result.Result.get_counts`.
