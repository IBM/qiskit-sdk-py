    Add the refactored Amplitude Estimation algorithms.
    The algorithms,
    * ``AmplitudeEstimation`` (Brassard et al.)
    * ``MaximumLikelihoodAmplitudeEstimation`` (Suzuki et al.)
    * ``IterativeAmplitudeEstimation`` (Grinko et al.)
    * ``FasterAmplitudeEstimation`` (Nakaji)
    are separated from the problem-specific information, such as the :math:`\mathcal{A}`
    and :math:`\mathcal{Q}` operators. This information is encapsulated in an
    ``EstimationProblem``. Each of the algorithms is thus re-usable for different problems and
    different algorithms can easily be compared on the same problem.
