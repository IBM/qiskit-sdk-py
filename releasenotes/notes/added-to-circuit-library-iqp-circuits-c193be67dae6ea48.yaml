features:
  - |
    Introduced IQP circuits. It can be used by
    ``from qiskit.circuit.library.iqp_circuit import IQPCircuit``
    ``A = np.array([[6, 5, 3], [5, 4, 5], [3, 5, 1]])``
    ``my_circuit = IQPCircuit(A)``
    ``my_circuit.draw()``
    To show inside the circuit you can use decompose method
    ``my_circuit.decompose().draw()``
