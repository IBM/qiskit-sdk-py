    A new global optimizer, DifferentialEvolution, is added 
    based on `scipy.optimize.differential_evolution`.
    This optimizer belongs to the family of evolutionary 
    algorithms such as genetic and particle swarm algorithms. 
    It is best suited for combinatorial optimization problems 
    and operates on real-parameter and real-valued objective functions.
