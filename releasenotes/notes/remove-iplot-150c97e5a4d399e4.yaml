    The interactive plotting functions from :mod:`qiskit.visualizations`,
    ``iplot_bloch_multivector``, ``iplot_state_city``, ``iplot_state_qsphere``,
    ``iplot_state_hinton``, ``iplot_histogram``, ``iplot_state_paulivec`` have
    been removed. The hosted static JS code that these functions relied on
    has been removed and they no longer could work. A deprecation wasn't
    possible because the site they depended on no longer exists.
