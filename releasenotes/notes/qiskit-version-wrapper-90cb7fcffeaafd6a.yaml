    The ``qiskit.__qiskit_version__`` module attribute was previously a ``dict``
    will now return a custom read-only ``Mapping`` object that checks the
    version of qiskit elements at runtime instead of at import time. This was
    done to speed up the import path of qiskit and eliminate a possible import
    cycle by only importing the element packages at runtime if the version
    is needed from the package. This should be fully compatible with the
    ``dict`` previously return and for most normal use cases there will be no
    difference. However, if some applications were relying on either mutating
    the contents or explicitly type checking it may require updates to adapt to
    this change.

    The ``qiskit.execute`` module has been renamed to
    :mod:`qiskit.execute_function`. This was necessary to avoid a potentical
    name conflict between the :func:`~qiskit.execute_function.execute` function
    which is re-exported as ``qiskit.execute``. ``qiskit.execute`` the function
    in some situations could conflict with ``qiskit.execute`` the module which
    would lead to cryptic error because Python was treating ``qiskit.execute``
    as the module when the intent was to the function or vice versa. The module
    rename was necessary to avoid this conflict. If you're importing
    ``qiskit.execute`` to get the module (typical usage was
    ``from qiskit.execute import execute``) you will need to update this to
    use ``qiskit.execute_function`` instead.
