    The ``qiskit.__qiskit_version__`` module attribute was previously a ``dict``
    will now return a custom read-only ``Mapping`` object that checks the
    version of qiskit elements at runtime instead of at import time. This was
    done to speed up the import path of qiskit and eliminate a possible import
    cycle by only importing the element packages at runtime if the version
    is needed from the package. This should be fully compatible with the
    ``dict`` previously return and for most normal use cases there will be no
    difference. However, if some applications were relying on either mutating
    the contents or explicitly type checking it may require updates to adapt to
    this change.
