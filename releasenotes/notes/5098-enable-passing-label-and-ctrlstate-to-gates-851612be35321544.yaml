    Some gates did not allow passing label or ctrl_state parameters to them even though they 
    were implemented in their respective classes. This fixes issue #5098. The following is the list
    of gates that now properly accept label and/or ctrl_state parameters: 

    label: 
      h, i, id, ms, p, rccx, rcccx, rz, s, sdg, swap, sx, sxdg, t, tdg, u, u1, u2, u3, y, z

    label + ctrl_state: 
      ccx, fredkin, mcu1, toffoli, mcx, mct
