   StochasticSwap, SabreSwap, and LookaheadSwap are now noise aware, with the qubit distance calculations
   being weighted by the cx errors for each edge in the device coupling map.  Edges that are reported as
   faulty, i.e. cx_err = 1.0, are weighted by 1e99, which causes the swap mappers to avoid them at all cost
   (unless all possible routes include one or more such edges).
