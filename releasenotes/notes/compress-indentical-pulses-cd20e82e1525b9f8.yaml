    Schedule transformer :func:`qiskit.pulse.transforms.compress_pulses`
    performs an optimization pass to replace identical instances of
    a pulse in a pulse schedule that improves the usage of waveform
    memory in hardware and reduce confusion of pulse
    users running into waveform limits on hardware.
