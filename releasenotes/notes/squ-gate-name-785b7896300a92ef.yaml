    The :attr:`~qiskit.extensions.SingleQubitUnitary.name` attribute of the
    :class:`~qiskit.extensions.SingleQubitUnitary` gate class has been changed
    from ``unitary`` to ``squ``. This was necessary to avoid a conflict with
    the :class:`~qiskit.extensions.UnitaryGate` class's name which was also
    ``unitary`` since the 2 gates are not the same and don't have the same
    implementation (and can't be used interchangeably).
