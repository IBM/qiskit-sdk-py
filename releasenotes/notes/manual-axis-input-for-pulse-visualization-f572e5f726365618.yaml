    Pulse visualization now includes capability for putting in axis dimensions.
    Axis input comes in the form of a 2-element list, as [width, height] where
    both quantities are in dimensions of fraction of figure size.

    For example::
            sine_pulse = SamplePulse(np.sin(np.linspace(0,4*np.pi, 20)), name='random_pulse')
            ax = [0.5, 1]
            sine_pulse.draw(ax=ax)

    The sample pulse will then be drawn with the graph dimensions squeezed in the x-direction.
