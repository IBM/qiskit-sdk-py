features:

    The ``Instruction`` class now has a ``label`` attribute. This is a generalization of
    labels previously belonging to only ``Gate``s. A label is useful for distinguishing
    between different instances of the same instruction. This can be used for visualizing
    or simulating those instances differently.
  - |
    ``QuantumCircuit.append()`` now takes an optional ``label`` argument, which can be
    used to set the label of the appended instruction.
