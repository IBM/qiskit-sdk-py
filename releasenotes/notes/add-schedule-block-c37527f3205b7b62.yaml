    New pulse program representation :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock` is added.
    This representation is best suited for the builder syntax.

    This representation takes ``transform`` instead of specifying starting time ``t0`` for
    each instruction. The start time of instruction is implicitly allocated with
    the specified transformation and relative position of instructions.

    This representation allows lazy instruction scheduling, thus we can assign
    arbitrary parameter expression object to the duration of instructions.

    For example,

    .. code-block:: python

        dur = Parameter('rabi_duration')

        block = ScheduleBlock(transform='right')
        block += Play(Gaussian(dur, 0.1, dur/4), DriveChannel(0))
        block += Call(measure_sched)

    this code defines an experiment of scanning Gaussian pulse duration followed by
    the measurement, i.e. Rabi experiment. You can reuse ``block`` object for every
    scanned duration by assigning a target duration value.
