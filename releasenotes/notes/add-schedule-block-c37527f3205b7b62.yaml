    A new pulse program representation :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock` has been added.
    This representation is best suited for the pulse builder syntax and is based on relative instruction
    ordering.

    This representation takes ``transform`` instead of specifying starting time ``t0`` for
    each instruction. The start time of instruction is implicitly allocated with
    the specified transformation and relative position of instructions.

    This representation allows lazy instruction scheduling, meaning we can assign
    arbitrary parameters to the duration of instructions.

    For example,

    .. code-block:: python

        dur = Parameter('rabi_duration')

        block = ScheduleBlock(transform='right')
        block += Play(Gaussian(dur, 0.1, dur/4), DriveChannel(0))
        block += Call(measure_sched)

    this code defines an experiment scanning a Gaussian pulse's duration followed by
    a measurement, i.e. a Rabi experiment. You can reuse the ``block`` object for every
    scanned duration by assigning a target duration value.
