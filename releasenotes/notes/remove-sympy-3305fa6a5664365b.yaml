    the input to one of the supported types which are:
     * ``int``
     * ``float``
     * ``complex``
     * ``str``
     * ``np.ndarray``

    All sympy parameter output type support have been been removed (or
    deprecated as noted) from qiskit-terra. This includes sympy type
    parameters in circuits, qasm ast nodes, or qobjs.
