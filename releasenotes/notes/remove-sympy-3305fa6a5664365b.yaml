deprecations:
  - |
    Passing in Sympy types as instruction parameters are now deprecated.
    You'll need to convert the input to one of the supported types which
    are:

     * ``qiskit.qasm.Node``
     * ``int``
     * ``float``
     * ``complex``
     * ``str``
     * ``np.ndarray``
other:
  - |
    All sympy usage has been removed from qiskit-terra. If you were using
    sympy classes as inputs to Terra it should still work for this release,
    but it will likely stop working in ``0.11.0``.
