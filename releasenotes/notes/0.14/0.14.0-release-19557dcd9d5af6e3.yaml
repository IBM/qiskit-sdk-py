  The 0.14.0 release includes several new features and bug fixes. The biggest
  change for this release is the introduction of a library of quantum circuits
  in :mod:`qiskit.circuit.library`, containing some circuits of interest.
  The contents of this library will grow over time. Each circuit can be
  executed on its own, or used as a building block in building larger
  circuits. With this, Qiskit's circuits no longer assume an implicit
  initial state of :math:`|0\rangle`, and will not be drawn with this
  initial state. The all-zero initial state is still assumed on a backend
  when a circuit is executed.
