    A new requirement has been added to the requirements list,
    `retworkx <https://pypi.org/project/retworkx/>`_. It is an Apache 2.0
    licensed graph library that has a similar API to networkx and is being used
    to significantly speed up the :class:`qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit`
    operations as part of the transpiler. There are binaries published for all
    the platforms supported by Qiskit Terra but if you're using a platform
    where there aren't precompiled binaries published refer to the retworkx
    documentation for instructions on pip installing from sdist.
