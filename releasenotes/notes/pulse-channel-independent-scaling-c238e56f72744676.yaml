    Pulse visualizer can apply scaling factors independently for each channel.
    This option is available only for visualizing pulse schedules.
    Without specifying, visualizer checks maximum amplitude of pulses in
    each channel and applies its best-guess scaling factor to it. The scaling factor is
    displayed below the channel aliases. If you want to apply custom
    scaling factors, you can use a python dictionary as in the following example.

    example::
      import qiskit
      import qiskit.pulse.pulse_lib as pulse_lib

      drive0 = qiskit.pulse.DriveChannel(0)
      drive1 = qiskit.pulse.DriveChannel(1)

      # schedule to plot
      sched = qiskit.pulse.Schedule()
      sched = sched | pulse_lib.drag(30, 0.5, 5, 1)(drive0)
      sched = sched | pulse_lib.drag(30, 0.05, 5, 1)(drive1)

      # custom scaling factor
      scales = {drive0: 1, drive1: 10}

      sched.draw(scale=scales)

    If you apply a single scaling factor, the visualizer uses that value for all channels.

    example::
      scalings = 10
