    Pulse visualizer can apply scaling factor independently to each channel.
    This option is available only for visualizing pulse schedules.
    Without specifying, visualizer checks maximum amplitude of pulses in
    each channel and apply best scaling factor to it. The scaling factor is
    displayed just below the channel aliases. If you want to apply cunstom
    scaling factors, you can use python dictionary as following example.

    example::
      import qiskit
      import qiskit.pulse.pulse_lib as pulse_lib

      drive0 = qiskit.pulse.DriveChannel(0)
      drive1 = qiskit.pulse.DriveChannel(1)

      # schedule to plot
      sched = qiskit.pulse.Schedule()
      sched = sched | pulse_lib.drag(30, 0.5, 5, 1)(drive0)
      sched = sched | pulse_lib.drag(30, 0.05, 5, 1)(drive1)

      # custom scaling factor
      scalings = {drive0: 1, drive1: 10}

      sched.draw(scaling=scalings)

    If you apply single scaling factor, the visualizer use that value to all channels.

    example::
      scalings = 10
