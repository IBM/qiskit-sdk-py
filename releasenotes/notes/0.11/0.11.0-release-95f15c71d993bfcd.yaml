    The 0.11.0 release includes several new features and bug fixes. The biggest
    changes for this release are the additions of the pulse scheduler. 0.11.0
    is also the first release to include support for Python 3.8. It also
    marks the beginning of deprecation for Python 3.5, which will be removed
    when the upstream Python community stops supporting it.
