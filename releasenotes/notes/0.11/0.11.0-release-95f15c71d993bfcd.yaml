    The 0.11.0 release includes several new features and bug fixes. The biggest
    changes for this release are the additions of the pulse scheduler. This
    allows users to define their quantum program as a ``QuantumCircuit`` and
    then map it to the underlying pulse instructions that will control the
    quantum hardware to implement the circuit. 0.11.0 is also the first release
    to include support for Python 3.8. It also marks the beginning of
    deprecation for Python 3.5, which will be removed when the upstream Python
    community stops supporting it.
