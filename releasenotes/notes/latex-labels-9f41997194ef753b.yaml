    A new boolean kwarg flag, ``latex_labels``, has been added to
    ``qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer`` and ``qiskit.QuantumCircuit.draw``.
    This flag only is used by the ``latex`` and ``latex_source`` circuit drawer
    backends. When set on all other backends it will be ignored. When this flag
    is set to ``True`` with the latex drawers it will disable the automated
    conversion of input gate names from unicode to a latex encoding. This
    enables users who want to manually format gate names for rendering in latex
    to do so.
