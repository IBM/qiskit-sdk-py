    Channel ``buffer`` option was deprecated 4 months ago and has been removed.
    To add a delay on a channel, specify it explicitly in your Schedule with a
    Delay::

        sched = Schedule()
        sched += Delay(5)(DriveChannel(0))
  - |
    PulseChannelSpec has been deprecated 3 months and removed.
    Use BackendConfiguration instead::

        config = backend.configuration()
        drive_chan_0 = config.drives(0)
        acq_chan_0 = config.acquires(0)

    or, simply reference the channel directly, such as ``DriveChannel(index)``.

    An import path has been deprecated for 5 months and removed: for
    ``PulseChannel``, ``DriveChannel``, ``MeasureChannel``, and
    ``ControlChannel``, use ``from qiskit.pulse.channels import X`` in place of
    ``from qiskit.pulse.channels.pulse_channels import X``.
