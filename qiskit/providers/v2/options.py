class Options:

    This class is the abstract class that all backend options are based
    on. The properties of the class are intended to be all ddynamically
    adjustable so that a user can reconfigure the backend on demand. If a
    property is immutable to the user (eg something like number of qubits)
    that should be a property of the backend class (itself instead of the
    options.
