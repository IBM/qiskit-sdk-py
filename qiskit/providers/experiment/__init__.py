Experiment Interface (:mod:`qiskit.providers.experiment`)
=========================================================

.. currentmodule:: qiskit.providers.experiment

This module contains the classes used to build experiment services, which
allow users to store experiment data and metadata in databases. An experiment
typically has one or more jobs, analysis results, and graphs associated with it.

An experiment service provider can inherit the
:class:`~qiskit.providers.experiment.ExperimentService` class. An
experiment service consumer can inherit the
:class:`~qiskit.providers.experiment.ExperimentData` class, which already
has methods that interacts with the service implemented.
