[What is it]
A stochastic optimizer is under qiskit/tools/mcmc
 qoptimizer.py

[how to run it]
In PyCharm, simply run qoptimizer.py
You can change the file to be optimized by passing the argument "--qasm_files=your_qasm_path"

[What is the expected result?]
The optimized mutants, i.e., the mutants that are correct and have better performance, are stored into the folder mcmc_mutants_good.

At the bottom of each mutant program, we also show:
1 new_cost_correctness (correctness): the difference of the final amplitude vector (value=0 means the final vector is exactly the same as the original program)
2 new_cost_perf (performance): the increase of circuit depth (value<0 means the depth becomes shorter than the original program)
3 new_cost: sum of the above two.

Clearly, for optimized mutants, new_cost_correctness=0 and new_cost_perf<0


Besides, the log of the cost after each iteration is recorded in the folder mcmc_cost_logs
