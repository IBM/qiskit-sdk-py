[What is it]
An equivalence checker is under qiskit/tools/equivalence_checker:
 qchecker.py
Given two qasm programs, the tool checks whether their final amplitude vectors V1 and V2 are equivalent:
they differ only in the global phase, i.e., the equation V1*E^(I*x)=V2 has a solution.




[How to use it?]
python3 qchecker.py --file1 ./testcases/q3sat_small.qasm --file2 ./testcases/q3sat_small_equivalent.qasm


[Dependency]
1 goto qiskit root folder that has setup.py
    python3 setup.py install
2 pip3 install "sympy==1.0"
3 sympy based backend (will be included into qiskit soon): qiskit/backends/_sympy_qasmsimulator.py


[Analysis of the results and the Limit]
We run the tool over the qasm programs in testcases/ folder and tested three different branches in equivalence_checker.check_equivalence: (1) two input programs are equivalent, (2) are not equivalent, (3) cannot be checked because they do not agree on the qubits.

Note:
the sympy backend is a bit slow since it processes the quantum program gate by gate and a quantum program usually has many gates. If you aim for faster checking, please use qiskit/tools/fast_equivalence_checker, which processes the program at the layer granularity.
