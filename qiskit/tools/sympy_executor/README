[What is this?]
The tool offers a local execution backend, which applies sympy to perform the symbolic evaluation of the circuit.
It accepts the a qasm program as the input, and outputs the amplitude vectors of the qubits after every step in the circuit.

[Advantage]
1 the tool is non-intrusive, i.e., it does not require any modification of the qiskit core packages.
2 the tool obviates the manual calculation with a pen and paper, enabling quick adjustment of your prototype code.
3 the tool leverages sympy's symbolic computational power to keep the most precise form of the amplitude vector, e.g., e^{I*pi/4}. Besides, the tool leverages sympy's simplification engine to simplify the expressions as much as possible.
4 the tool supports u gates, including u1, u2, u3, cu1, cu2, cu3.


[How to use it?]
python3 sympy_executor.py --qasm_file /Users/liup/quantum/qiskit_dec_2017/qiskit/tools/sympy_executor/testcases/test.qasm

[How to run it over multiple files?]
Suppose all files are contained in ./test folder
find ./testcases -name "*.qasm" | xargs -I{} sh -c "python3 sympy_executor.py --qasm_file {} > {}.out 2>&1"

[Dependency]
1 goto qiskit root folder that has setup.py
    python3 setup.py install
2 pip3 install "sympy==1.0"
3 pip3 install "pydot==1.2.3"


[Analysis of the results and the Limit]
We run the tool over the qasm programs in testcases/ folder, where the output files have the ".out" suffix.
1 It can simplify the expressions, including the complex ones such as sqrt(2)*I*exp(-I*pi/4)/4. See 011_3_qubit_grover_50_.qasm.out, grover_4bits.qasm.out and q3sat_small.qasm.out.
2 It may miss some simplification opportunities. See qe_qft_3.qasm.out, the amplitude "0.245196320100808*sqrt(2)*exp(-I*pi/4) - 0.048772580504032*sqrt(2)*I*exp(-I*pi/4)" can be further simplified.
3 It may produce the results hard to interpret. See qe_qft_5.qasm.out.
4 Memory error may occur if there are many qubits in the system (see q3sat.qasm.out). This is due to the limit of classical computers and show the advantage of the quantum hardware.
5 It does not support the qasm that uses the "if" construct.  See ipea_3_pi_8.qasm.out.
