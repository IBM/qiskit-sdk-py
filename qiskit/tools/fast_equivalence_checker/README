[What is the goal of an equivalence checker?]
An equivalence checker is under qiskit/tools/fast_equivalence_checker:
 qchecker.py
Given two qasm programs, the tool checks whether their final amplitude vectors V1 and V2 are equivalent:
they differ only in the global phase, i.e., the equation V1*E^(I*x)=V2 has a solution.

Note: The checker is at least 10X faster than equivalence_checker_with_sympy_backend.
It is optimized by processing the quantum circuit layer by layer, rather than gate by gate.


[How to use it?]
python3 qchecker.py --file1 ./testcases/q3sat_small.qasm --file2 ./testcases/q3sat_small_equivalent.qasm


[Dependency]
1 goto qiskit root folder that has setup.py
    python3 setup.py install
2 pip3 install "sympy==1.0"
3 pip3 install "pydot==1.2.3"


[Analysis of the results and the Limit]
We run the tool over the qasm programs in testcases/ folder and tested three different branches in equivalence_checker.check_equivalence: (1) two input programs are equivalent, (2) are not equivalent, (3) cannot be checked because they do not agree on the qubits.

Besides, the equivalence checker inherits the limitations from the sympy executor:
(1) it may lead to out-of-memory errors if too many qubits are involved,
(2) it does not support the qasm that uses the "if" construct.

Please feel free to let us know when you encounter problems while using the tool.
