    The gate is anonymous (not tied to a named quantum register),

    have the same string name as the circuit.

    Args:
        circuit (QuantumCircuit): the input circuit.

    Return:
        Gate: a gate equivalent to the action of the input circuit.
              Upon decomposition, this gate will
              yield the components comprising the original circuit.

        QiskitError: if the circuit is non-reversible and thus not a Gate.
