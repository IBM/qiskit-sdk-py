"""
Example showing how to use assertions in Qiskit-Terra at level 0 (novice).

It builds a bell state circuit with assertions
and runs it on the BasicAer (local Qiskit provider).

This corresponds to the first example in using_qiskit_terra_level_0.py
within basic Qiskit Terra examples.

To control the compile parameters we have provided a transpile function which can be used
as a level 1 user.
