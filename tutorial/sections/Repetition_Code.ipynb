    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this study is to look at the properties of the repetion code when run using the 16 qubit *ibmqx3* device.\n",
    "\n",
    "The repetition code is a classical error correcting code, with which a collection of noisy bits can be used to store a bit value with arbitrarily low noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code can also be interpreted as a quantum error correcting code, in which the noisy bits are replaced by noisy qubits. Such a code can be used to store a *bit* with arbitrarily low noise. However, due to the limited set of errors that can be detected and corrected, it cannot fully protect a *qubit*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this fact, the repetition code based on qubits nevertheless uses the same resources and techniques as other quantum codes. It can therefore serve as a prelimary test of quantum error correction. An introduction to these concepts for a general audience can be found [here](http://decodoku.blogspot.ch/2016/01/what-is-error-correction-what-is.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, the most extensive experiments of quantum repetition codes were implemented a few years ago by the team at Google/UCSB.\n",
    "\n",
    "[J. Kelly et al., Nature **519**, *66â€“69* (2015)](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v519/n7541/full/nature14270.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest repetition code in this experiment used 5 qubits to store data (we call these *code qubits*), and an additional 4 *ancilla qubits* to mediate measurements. In this notebook we will use the 16 qubit device *ibmqx3* to implement codes of a variety of sizes, including some larger than those in the Google/UCSB experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of code qubits in our experiments will be denoted *d*. The number of ancilla qubits in a repetition code is always *d-1*, one less than that of code qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also use an additional qubit that is not part of the code, to compare storing a bit in a code with storing it in a single qubit. The total number of qubits needed is therefore *2d*. We will consider codes for *d=3...8*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each case we will do a single round of ancilla-assisted syndrome measurement followed by direct measurement of all qubits. This allows us to read out the value of the stored bit, as well as clues about errors that it may have suffered. Using this information, we can try to correct for the effects of the errors and recover the original value of the stored bit. By looking at how often this process succeeds, we will be able to see how well the system implements quantum error correction.\n",
