    "In this version of the game, two types of attack will be allowed: Bomb and Torpedo. But some ships can be immune to certain types of attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where it starts getting a bit quantum. Each ship can only be certain about whether or not it is immune to one type of attack. So if it is immune to bombs and you fire a torpedo, it will be random whether you attack succeeds or not. If it fails, the ship become certain that it is immune to torpedos. The effect of a bomb attack will then be random. By switching between attacks, you'll eventually destroy it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ships are made in the same shipyard, which means they have some correlations at the beginning. These correlations cause the ships to obey the following rules for the results of their first attack.\n",

    "\n",
    "* If one is destroyed by a torpedo attack, the other would repel a bomb attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "These rules can be used to increase the chances of destroying both ships early on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This game mechanic is realized on a quantum computer by using a qubit for each ship. Bomb attacks correspond to Z measurement, and torpedo attacks are X measurements. The outcome zero implies a failed attack (and so the ship is immune) and the outcome 1 implies that the ship has been destroyed. The correlations are acheived by initializing the qubits in an entangled state. The state used is one that corresponds to Hardy's paradox.\n",
